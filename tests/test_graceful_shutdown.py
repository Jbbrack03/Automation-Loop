Tests for graceful shutdown handling functionality.

        Test that graceful shutdown handlers can be registered and trigger cleanup.
        
        This test verifies the graceful shutdown implementation for Task 13.5:
        1. Signal handlers can be registered for SIGTERM and SIGINT
        2. The handler sets a shutdown flag when triggered
        3. The handler performs cleanup operations including state saving
        4. Resources are properly cleaned up during shutdown
        
        This test follows the FIRST principles:
        - Fast: Uses mocking to avoid actual signal handling and file I/O delays
        - Independent: Creates isolated test environment with mocked dependencies
        - Repeatable: Deterministic behavior through controlled mocking
        - Self-validating: Clear assertions on handler registration and cleanup behavior
        - Timely: Written before graceful shutdown implementation exists (red phase of TDD)
        
        The test will fail initially because automate_dev.py currently does not
        implement any graceful shutdown handling or signal handler registration.
