        Test that run_claude_command detects usage limit errors and retries after waiting.
        
        This test verifies the complete usage limit handling integration:
        1. First subprocess.run call returns usage limit error in stdout/stderr
        2. run_claude_command detects the usage limit pattern in the output
        3. Calls parse_usage_limit_error to extract reset time information
        4. Calls calculate_wait_time to determine how long to wait
        5. Calls time.sleep to wait for the specified duration
        6. Retries the subprocess.run call with the same command
        7. Second call succeeds and returns valid JSON output
        8. Function returns the successful result
        
        The test follows FIRST principles:
        - Fast: Uses mocks to avoid actual subprocess calls and waiting
        - Independent: Runs in isolation with no external dependencies
        - Repeatable: Produces consistent results with mocked behavior
        - Self-validating: Has clear assertions about retry behavior
        - Timely: Tests the integration before implementation exists
        
        This test will initially fail because run_claude_command doesn't detect
        or handle usage limit errors yet - it needs to be modified to:
        1. Check output for usage limit indicators
        2. Call usage limit parsing and calculation functions
        3. Sleep and retry when usage limits are detected
        
        This is the RED phase of TDD - the test must fail first.
