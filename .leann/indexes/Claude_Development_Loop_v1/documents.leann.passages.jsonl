The system requires a **user-provided PRD and Implementation Plan** as prerequisites, rejecting automation if these are missing. It uses an **MCP Server for reliable status reporting** through structured tool calls instead of text parsing, ensuring consistent status capture. Combined with **transactional state management** where only `/update` modifies state after validation, it eliminates race conditions. The orchestrator **captures and passes validation output** to correction commands, ensuring proper context flow. The solution uses **verified CLI flags** (`--output-format json --dangerously-skip-permissions`) that work with Claude Code Max subscriptions, **timestamp-based status files** to prevent stale status confusion, and **comprehensive observability** with multi-level logging. All file references use the standardized `Implementation_Plan.md` filename.

The orchestrator script can be designed to be stateless. If it crashes, it can be restarted, and its first action will be to read Implementation_Plan.md to determine precisely where the workflow left off. This makes the process idempotent and recoverable. Furthermore, this pattern offers unparalleled transparency. A developer can, at any moment, open the Implementation_Plan.md file to see the exact status of the automated task. They can even manually intervene by editing the file—for instance, by changing a task from \\[X\\] (done) back to \\[ \\] (to-do) to force it to be re-run, or by adding new tasks mid-workflow.

An incorrect or unreliable signal can cause the loop to advance prematurely or get stuck indefinitely.

The Stop hook is configured in a settings.json file (preferably .claude/settings.local.json to avoid committing it to source control) to execute a simple, low-overhead shell command. A command like `touch .claude/signal_task_complete` is perfect. This creates an empty \"signal file\" whose existence serves as an unambiguous notification to the external orchestrator script that the task is complete.10 The orchestrator can then simply wait for this file to appear.\n\n**Important Note**: The Stop hook fires only after ALL work is complete, including any sub-agent tasks initiated via the Task tool. This makes it the single, reliable signal for session completion without requiring complex multi-signal monitoring or brittle idle detection.10\n\n### **Method 2: Programmatic Control with the Claude Code SDK**\n\nA more powerful, albeit more complex, alternative is to use the Claude Code SDK, which is available for TypeScript and Python.13 The SDK provides a programmatic interface to the agent, allowing for fine-grained control over the interaction.", "metadata": {}}

This model leverages the strengths of each component while mitigating its weaknesses.\n\nThe workflow is as follows:\n\n1. **Initiation:** The external Orchestrator script uses Method 3 (claude \\-p \"/run-next-task\"...) to kick off a specific task. This is the correct and most direct way to inject a command into the agent non-interactively.  \n2. **Waiting:** Instead of waiting for the process to exit, the Orchestrator immediately begins waiting for the signal file created by the Stop hook (Method 1). Its waiting logic becomes a simple, reliable file-polling loop: while \\[\\! \\-f.claude/signal\\_task\\_complete \\]; do sleep 1; done.  \n3. **Signaling:** When Claude Code finishes its work, the Stop hook fires automatically and creates the signal file.  \n4. **Continuation:** The Orchestrator's waiting loop breaks, and it proceeds to the next step in its logic (e.g., parsing the output, checking the state in Implementation_Plan.md).", "metadata": {}}

Any automation system must detect and gracefully handle this scenario.\n\n#### **Detection Strategy**\n\nThe orchestrator must monitor the Claude Code output for usage limit messages.

Its native support for JSON parsing (json module), robust error handling (try...except blocks), and clear syntax for complex conditional logic make it far better suited for the user's requirements.14 The  \n  subprocess module provides a powerful and flexible way to call the Claude Code CLI.\n\n### **The Python Orchestrator (automate\\_dev.py) - Enhanced Version**\n\nThe following is a complete, well-commented Python script that implements the orchestrator logic with proper failure tracking, structured output parsing, and comprehensive logging.

{"id": "132", "text": "## **Section XIV: Conclusion: Your Production-Ready Development Workflow**\n\nThe challenge of automating a repetitive development workflow with Claude Code can be solved with a robust and resilient architecture that moves beyond simple scripting into the realm of agentic orchestration. The proposed solution is built on standard, well-documented features of Claude Code and is designed specifically to address the core requirements of reliability and conditional logic.\n\nThe recommended architecture can be summarized as follows:  \nA Python Orchestrator script acts as the central controller. This script's logic is driven by an external State File (Implementation_Plan.md), which provides a durable and transparent record of the workflow's progress. The Orchestrator initiates tasks by calling state-aware Slash Commands using the non-interactive claude \\-p command. Crucially, it does not rely on the command's process exit for completion. Instead, it waits for a definitive signal created by a Claude Code Hook. A Stop event hook, configured to create a simple signal file, provides the reliable trigger mechanism needed to sequence tasks correctly.  \nThis hybrid architecture directly solves the primary challenges:", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "133", "text": "* **Reliability:** The use of the Stop hook provides an unambiguous signal of task completion, while the external Implementation_Plan.md file ensures the workflow's state is durable and can survive script crashes.  \n* **Conditional Logic:** By instructing the agent to produce a structured status message (e.g., \"STATUS: SUCCESS\") and parsing this from the JSON output of the CLI, the orchestrator can implement branching logic to handle failures and create self-correcting loops.  \n* **Avoiding Brittleness:** The entire system is transparent. The state is in a plain text file, the actions are in readable Markdown files, and the logic is contained in a clear Python script. There are no opaque or unreliable mechanisms.", "metadata": {}}
{"id": "134", "text": "By adopting this pattern—combining an external orchestrator, a durable state file, state-aware slash commands, and event-driven hooks—developers can transform their predictable workflows into a fully automated, efficient, and reliable development process. The provided blueprints for the orchestrator script and slash commands serve as a powerful starting point, ready to be adapted to the specific, repetitive development cycles of any project. This approach empowers developers to delegate entire workflows to their AI assistant, achieving a new and profound level of automation.\n\n## **Section XI: Implementation Notes for Private Networks**\n\n### **Security Considerations**\n\nThis automation system is designed for **private use on local networks only**.

Without this flag, Claude Code will pause for permission prompts, breaking the automation loop.\n2. **No Input Sanitization**: Since this is for private use, the system doesn't implement input sanitization for slash commands.\n3. **Plaintext State Files**: Acceptable for local development environments.\n4. **No Authentication**: The orchestrator assumes trusted local access.\n\n### **The /clear Command**\n\nThe `/clear` command is a built-in Claude Code command (not a custom slash command) that:\n\n- **Clears**: All conversation history from the current session\n- **Preserves**: The CLAUDE.md file which acts as persistent project memory\n- **Requires**: A 20-second wait after clearing to ensure context is fully reset\n- **Purpose**: Prevents context accumulation and token exhaustion during long sessions", "metadata": {}}
