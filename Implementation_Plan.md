# **Implementation Plan: Automated Claude Code Development Workflow**

**Project:** Architecting a Resilient, Automated Development Loop with Claude Code  
**Development Methodology:** Test-Driven Development (TDD)  
**Target Executor:** AI Coding Agent

## **Overview**

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step plan to implement the automated development workflow as specified in the "Architecting a Resilient, Automated Development Loop with Claude Code" PRD. Each phase and task is designed to be executed sequentially by an AI coding agent. The TDD approach ensures that for every piece of functionality, a failing test is written first, followed by the implementation code to make the test pass.

## **Phase 9: Usage Limit Handling**

**Goal:** Make the orchestrator resilient to Claude Max API usage limits.

  - In `test_orchestrator.py`, write tests for the `parse_usage_limit_error` function.
  - Include test cases for both the natural language time format (e.g., "7pm (America/Chicago)") and the Unix timestamp format.
  - Also test the `calculate_wait_time` helper function.

- [ ] **Task 9.2: Implement Usage Limit Functions**
  - In `automate_dev.py`, implement the `parse_usage_limit_error`, `calculate_wait_time`, and `handle_usage_limit` functions exactly as specified in the PRD.
  - Run the tests from Task 9.1 to confirm they pass.

- [ ] **Task 9.3: Integrate Usage Limit Handling**
  - In `automate_dev.py`, modify the `run_claude_command` function to check the captured output for the usage limit error string. If found, it should call the handler and retry the command.
  - Write a test to verify this retry behavior.

## **Phase 10: Logging and Final Polish**

**Goal:** Add comprehensive logging and finalize the project.
