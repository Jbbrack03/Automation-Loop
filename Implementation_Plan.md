# **Implementation Plan: Automated Claude Code Development Workflow**

**Project:** Architecting a Resilient, Automated Development Loop with Claude Code  
**Development Methodology:** Test-Driven Development (TDD)  
**Target Executor:** AI Coding Agent

## **Overview**

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step plan to implement the automated development workflow as specified in the "Architecting a Resilient, Automated Development Loop with Claude Code" PRD. Each phase and task is designed to be executed sequentially by an AI coding agent. The TDD approach ensures that for every piece of functionality, a failing test is written first, followed by the implementation code to make the test pass.
