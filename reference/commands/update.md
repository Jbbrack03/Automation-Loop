Update the implementation plan and perform comprehensive git operations with enhanced release management.

## Tasks to Complete:

1. **Generate/Update CHANGELOG.md**:
   - Analyze commits since last release using: `git log --oneline --pretty=format:"- %s" $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD`
   - Group changes by type: Features, Bug Fixes, Refactoring, Documentation, Dependencies
   - Create clear, user-friendly descriptions of changes
   - Only update if there are meaningful commits

2. **Version Management**:
   - Determine version bump type based on changes:
     * **PATCH**: Bug fixes, minor updates
     * **MINOR**: New features, significant improvements  
     * **MAJOR**: Breaking changes (check commit messages for "BREAKING CHANGE")
   - Update version in appropriate manifest files:
     * package.json (Node.js)
     * Cargo.toml (Rust) 
     * pyproject.toml or setup.py (Python)
     * go.mod (Go)
     * Package.swift (Swift)
     * pom.xml (Java)
   - Follow semantic versioning principles

3. **Security-Focused Dependency Updates**:
   ```bash
   # Check for security updates only (don't update everything)
   npm audit fix || pip-audit --fix || cargo audit fix
   
   # Update lock files if needed
   npm install || pip install -r requirements.txt || cargo update
   ```

4. **Git Operations**:
   ```bash
   # Stage all changes including generated files
   git add -A
   
   # Create meaningful commit message
   git commit -m "chore: release v[VERSION]
   
   - Updated CHANGELOG.md
   - Bumped version to [VERSION]  
   - Updated dependencies (security fixes)

   # Smart push logic - handle local-only repositories
   if git remote -v | grep -q origin; then
     # Remote exists, try to push
     if git push origin main 2>/dev/null || git push origin master 2>/dev/null; then
       echo "‚úÖ Successfully pushed to remote repository"
     else
       echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  Remote push failed, but local commit succeeded"
       echo "üìù Consider setting up remote repository for backup"
     fi
   else
     echo "üìù No remote repository configured - local commits only"
     echo "‚ÑπÔ∏è  To add remote: git remote add origin <your-repo-url>"
   fi
   ```

5. **Smart Detection and Error Handling**:
   - Check git status to see what actually changed
   - Only perform updates if changes warrant them
   - If push fails due to conflicts: Alert user with specific guidance
   - If version conflicts detected: Suggest resolution approach
   - If changelog generation fails: Continue with manual note

6. **Update Progress & Memory**:
   - Locate this project's Implementation Plan document and update it by checking off the tasks that you completed during this session. Add short comments if appropriate. Review any unchecked tasks from previous phases and session and determine whether they should be checked off (search LEANN for past implementation information if needed). Check off any items that are truly complete. Our goal is for this document to be a true record of our progress and next steps.
   - Build LEANN to add work from this session to the LEANN MCP Server Database
   - Add short status notes to Claude.md
