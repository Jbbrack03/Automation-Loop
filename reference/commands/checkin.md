Perform a comprehensive project review to verify all requirements have been met and the project is ready for completion.

## Review Checklist:

1. **Requirements Verification**:
   - Review original project requirements and user stories (read the original PRD if available)
   - Verify all planned features have been implemented (review all Implementation documentation)
   - Check that edge cases and error scenarios are handled
   - Use zen MCP Server to run an audit of our codebase to surface any issues that may exist. Validate Zen's findings to ensure accuracy before adding any found issues to our implementation plan document.

2. **Code Quality Assessment**:
   - Ensure code follows established patterns and conventions
   - Verify proper error handling throughout the application
   - Check for adequate test coverage (aim for >80%)
   - Review for any TODO comments or placeholder code

3. **Documentation Review**:
   - Verify README is up to date with current functionality
   - Check that code comments are clear and helpful
   - Ensure API documentation (if applicable) is complete

4. **Design, UX, and UI**:
   - Review our UI and UX. Are we following best practices?
   - Is our design attractive and professional?
   - Have we applied our design and theme consistently throughout our project?
   - Are we using the proper fonts, typography, buttons, and graphical elements throughout our project?

5. **Testing Validation**:
   - Run complete test suite and verify all tests pass
   - Test critical user workflows manually if needed
   - Verify no regression issues have been introduced

6. **If Validation Fails**:
   - If you find any gaps or issues, create new phases to address the issues that you found. Update the project's Implementation Plan document with these new phases and tasks.
   - Any phases or tasks that you add to the Implementation Plan document must be comprehensive and should be written so that an AI Agent can implement correctly and accurately without guessing
   - DO NOT create a new Implementation Plan document. Instead locate the one belonging to this project and update that instead.
   - Update Claude.md with a summary if your findings.
