### Testing
- Added 2 comprehensive tests for main loop scenarios
- All 26 tests now passing (100% success rate)
- Applied strict TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle

## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-14

### Features

  - Enables predictable automation workflow with signal detection
  - Added ensure_settings_file() function for automatic setup

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced code organization with DEFAULT_SETTINGS_CONFIG structure
- Improved constants management using json.dumps for configuration
- Added comprehensive error handling for settings file operations
- Extended test coverage to 24 tests (100% passing)

  - Timestamped JSON status files in .claude/ directory
  - Structured status reporting for automation workflow
- Created all custom slash commands for workflow automation
  - /continue - Implement next task using TDD
  - /validate - Run tests and report validation status
  - /update - Mark tasks complete and report project status
  - /correct - Fix validation failures
  - /checkin - Comprehensive project review
  - /refactor - Analyze refactoring opportunities
  - /finalize - Implement refactoring tasks
- Added get_latest_status function for status file management
  - Reads newest status file based on timestamp

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced MCP server with type safety and constants
- Improved timestamp handling and consistency
- Added comprehensive documentation for all slash commands
- Extended test coverage to 22 tests (100% passing)
- Applied full TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle for Phase 4

### Documentation
- Updated Implementation Plan with completion of Phases 4-5
- Comprehensive command documentation with status reporting structures
- Clear requirements and process documentation for each command
